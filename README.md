# Mechanic-Corpus

This is the mechanic corpus collected during and used as a data source in the project **Beyond Satisfaction: Game Feel Design for Emotionally Impactful Experiences**. The full paper can be found at ->link added on publication<-. The paper aims to study the relationship between game feel and emotionally impactful experiences within video games.

The corpus documents a total of 116 game mechanics (46 from the authors and 70 from participants) that relate to an emotional experience in a video game. Each mechanic is defined and its game feel design has been analyzed. We also provide reference videos demonstrating the mechanics. You can choose between author, participant, and crowdsourced examples by selecting the relevant sheet at the bottom of the spreadsheet document.
