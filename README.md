# Mechanic-Corpus

This is the mechanic corpus used as a data source in the paper **Beyond Satisfaction: Game Feel Design for Emotionally Impactful Experiences**. The paper aims to study the relationship between game feel and emotionally impactful experiences within video games.

The corpus documents a total of 116 game mechanics (46 from the authors and 70 from participants) that relate to an emotional experience in a video game. Each mechanic is defined and it's game feel design has been analyzed. We also provide reference videos demonstrating the mechanics.
